This directory contains the Java examples.

After a complete installation procedure:
./configure
make
sudo make install
check the Java JNI library that has been built and installed:
ls -la @libdir@/libflom_java.*

Read the comments inside
	Basic.java
	Advanced.java
	Transactional.java
to understand how these Java programs can be executed.

FLoM Java package uses JNI to access libflom C API functions: libflom_java
must be loadable by your JVM.
You can add @libdir@ directory to your LD_LIBRARY_PATH
environment variable, for example:
	export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:@libdir@
or alternatively you can use
	java -Djava.library.path=@libdir@ ...
to tell the JVM where C libraries can be found (other than in standard
system library path)
