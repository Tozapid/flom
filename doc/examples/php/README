This directory contains PHP examples: this is work in progress and all this
stuff must be integrated inside autoconf/automake

After a complete installation procedure:
./configure
make
sudo make install
check the PHP modules have been built and installe:
ls -la /usr/local/lib/flom-php*

This is the command line to run the example:

php -d extension=flom.so basic.php

if for any reason "flom.so" link was not created inside your PHP standard
extension directory, you can point it directly from the FLoM installation path:

php -d extension=/usr/local/lib/flom-php-module.so basic.php
