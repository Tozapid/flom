This directory contains the example programs: choose the programming language
of your interest and pick-up the example you can use as a starting point to
develop your own custom software that uses libflom API.

C examples: basic_static.c basic_dynamic.c advanced_static.c advanced_dynamic.c
How to compile:
	make -f example_makefile basic_static
	make -f example_makefile basic_dynamic
	make -f example_makefile advanced_static
	make -f example_makefile advanced_dynamic
or
	make -f example_makefile

Before running "basic_static" or "basic_dynamic" you have to start a local 
FLoM daemon listening default local socket:
	flom -d -1 -- true

Before running "advanced_static" or "advanced_dynamic" you have to start a
local FLoM daemon listening a specific local socket:
	flom -s /tmp/my_socket_name -d -1 -- true

To trace FLoM API calls you have to set FLOM_TRACE_MASK environment variable
(bash example):
	export FLOM_TRACE_MASK=0x8000
before program execution.

The directory @libdir@ may be already in your standard library path; in
the case it's not, you can use LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable before
executing the compiled programs:
	export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:@libdir@
	./basic_static
	./basic_dynamic
	./advanced_static
	./advanced_dynamic

More exhaustive examples related to setter and getter methods provided by the
API are available in @abs_top_builddir@/tests/src dir:
	case0002.c	for the C language
	case1002.cc	for the C++ language
	case2002.php	for the PHP language
	case3002.py	for the Python language
	case4002.jave	for the Java language
