.SH NAME
flom \- serialize command execution
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "flom"
[\fIOPTION\fP] [-- [\fICOMMAND\fP [\fIARG\fP]...]]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Run COMMAND serializing it with other commands executed by flom.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP 4
.B "-h, --help"
show help options
.TP
.B -v, --version
print flom version and exit
.TP
.B -x, --quiesce-exit
stop the running daemon after current activity completion
.TP
.B -X, --immediate-exit
stop the running daemon immediately without any quiesce time
.TP
.B -V, --verbose
verbose mode execution
.TP
.B -c, --config-file=\fIFILENAME
user configuration file name. Flom tries to read system default configuration file @sysconfdir@/@_SYSTEM_CONFIG_FILENAME@, user default configuration file ~/@_USER_CONFIG_FILENAME@ and finally this file if specified. Definitive configuration is obtained overloading hard wired build time defaults, system defaults, user defaults, user custom, command line options.
.TP
.B -r, --resource-name=\fIRESOURCE
name of the resource used for enqueing (locking). 
 
\fBSimple resource\fP names can be composed of "alpha" and "digit" characters, but the first character \fBmust be\fP of type "alpha" (example: "RA123" is \fBOK\fP, "123RA" is \fBnot\fP OK). Accepted resource names are described in function "global_res_name_preg_init": inspect source code for more details
 
\fBNumeric resource\fP names are composed by simple resource names followed by an integer value enclosed in square brackets ("[ ]"); examples: "foo[12]", "bar[3]", "RA123[23]". Numbers must be expressed using decimal base)

\fBResource set\fP names are obtained concatenating simple resource names with character '@_RESOURCE_SET_SEPARATOR@' (example: "RED@_RESOURCE_SET_SEPARATOR@BLUE@_RESOURCE_SET_SEPARATOR@GREEN")

\fBHierarchical resource\fP names are like \fBabsolute\fP path filenames using "@_DIR_FILE_SEPARATOR@" as the level delimiter (but a trailing delimiter is not allowed); examples: "@_DIR_FILE_SEPARATOR@apple", "@_DIR_FILE_SEPARATOR@apple@_DIR_FILE_SEPARATOR@pear" are valid names while "@_DIR_FILE_SEPARATOR@apple@_DIR_FILE_SEPARATOR@" and "@_DIR_FILE_SEPARATOR@apple@_DIR_FILE_SEPARATOR@pear@_DIR_FILE_SEPARATOR@" are \fBnot\fP valid names

.TP
.B -w, --resource-wait=\fIyes|no
\fBdefault\fP (\fIyes\fP): the command will enqueue if the resource is already locked by someone else, otherwise (\fIno\fP) it will return immediately
.TP
.B -o, --resource-timeout=\fImilliseconds
\fBdefault\fP (\fI-1\fP): maximum enqueue time if the resource is already locked by someone else; if the resource doesn't become free before \fItimeout milliseconds\fP the command will return. A negative value means "infinite timeout" and the command will wait until the resource will become free
.TP
.B -q, --resource-quantity=\fInumber
\fInumber\fP of numeric resources to lock; it's meaningless if the locked resource is not of type "numeric". \fInumber\fP must be an integer positive number. Note: only positive values are accepted
.TP
.B -e, --resource-create=\fIyes|no
\fBdefault\fP (\fIyes\fP): the command will create the resource if it was not already created by another command, otherwise (\fIno\fP) it will wait for resource creation or will end immediately (see \fB-w, --resource-wait\fP option). \fBNote:\fP if used with a \fIhierarchical resource\fP, the behavior applies to the root level of the resource, not to the single leaf
.TP
.B -i, --resource-idle-lifespan=\fImilliseconds
how long a resource will be kept after last usage, default value is \fB0 milliseconds\fP; this option can be used to avoid a following job that specifies \fB-e n, --resource-create=no\fP will wait undefinitely just because the previous task termited earliest. \fBWarning:\fP too many long lasting resources can waste memory and threads inside \fIflom daemon\fP. \fBNote:\fP if used with a \fIhierarchical resource\fP, the behavior applies to the root level of the resource, not to the single leaf
.TP
.B -l, --lock-mode=\fIMODE
lock mode as defined by VMS DLM (Distributed Lock Manager). \fIMODE\fP can be: "NullLock", "ConcurrentRead", "ConcurrentWrite", "ProtectedRead", "ProtectedWrite", "Exclusive" (equivalent short forms are: "NL", "CR", "CW", "PR", "PW", "EX"). More information are available here \fIhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_lock_manager#Lock_modes\fP
.TP
.B -s, --socket-name=\fIFILENAME
absolute \fIFILENAME\fP that must be used to create the UNIX socket used for local communication between \fBflom\fP command line and \fBflom daemon\fP; typical values are something like \fI/tmp/something\fP. This option is useful to share locks between different users (the default socket is per user and every user creates a different one)
.TP
.B -a, --unicast-address=\fIIPaddress
TCP/IP address that must be used to reach a running daemon; if the daemon must be started locally, \fIIPaddress\fP must be a valid IP address for this host
.TP
.B -p, --unicast-port=\fIIPport
TCP/IP port that must be used to reach a running daemon; if the daemon must be started locally, \fIIPport\fP must be a port not used by another process on this host. If \fIIPaddress\fP (see \fB-a\fP, \fB--unicast-address\fP) is specified and \fIIPport\fP is not specified, the default value is @_DEFAULT_DAEMON_PORT@
.TP
.B -A, --multicast-address=\fIIPaddress
UDP/IP multicast address that must be used to discover the location of a running daemon; if the daemon must be started locally, \fIIPaddress\fP must be a valid multicast IP address for this host. Multicast address ranges are: 224.0.0.1 - 224.0.0.255 (link-local), 239.255.0.0 - 239.255.255.255 (site-local), 239.192.0.0 - 239.195.255.255 (organization-local) and 224.0.1.0 - 238.255.255.255 (global); a typical choice is an address in \fIlink-local\fP or in \fIsite-local\fP range
.TP
.B -P, --multicast-port=\fIIPport
UDP/IP multicast port that must be used to discover the location of a running daemon; if the daemon must be started locally, \fIIPport\fP must be a port not used by another process on this host. If \fIIPaddress\fP (see \fB-A\fP, \fB--multicast-address\fP) is specified and \fIIPport\fP is not specified, the default value is @_DEFAULT_DAEMON_PORT@
.TP
.B -d, --daemon-lifespan=\fImilliseconds
lifespan of \fBflom\fP daemon if activated, expressed using milliseconds. The value of \fImilliseconds\fP can be and integer greater than 0, equal to 0 or less than 0: values greater than 0 are interpreted as minimum daemon lifetime (in milliseconds), the value 0 is interpreted as "don't start a daemon process" and values less than 0 are interpreted as "run forever" (or until a kill message is sent to \fBflom\fP daemon). If not specified, the default value is @_DEFAULT_DAEMON_LIFESPAN@ milliseconds
.TP
.B -D, --discovery-attempts=\fIattempts
number of attempts (UDP/IP multicast sent datagrams) performed to locate \fBflom\fP daemon; if the answer to UDP/IP multicast does not arrive, auto-discovery will fail. If not specified, the default value is @_DEFAULT_DISCOVERY_ATTEMPTS@
.TP
.B -I, --discovery-timeout=\fImilliseconds
timeout related to UDP/IP multicast auto-discovery feature: if the answer to UDP/IP multicast query does not arrive before this timeout, another datagram is sent (until \fIattempts\fP limit is reached). If not specified, the default value is @_DEFAULT_DISCOVERY_TIMEOUT@ milliseconds
.TP
.B --discovery-ttl=\fITTL
IP hop limit for outgoing UDP/IP multicast datagrams (this option may be useful if your datagrams have to traverse some router). If not specified, the default value is @_DEFAULT_DISCOVERY_TTL@
.TP
.B --tcp-keepalive-time=\fIseconds
\fBflom\fP daemon sets SO_KEEPALIVE attribute to every TCP/IP socket connected with a \fBflom\fP command; this parameter allows you to change after how many connection inactivity \fIseconds\fP the kernel will start to probe the TCP/IP connection. A good explanation of \fBtcp_keepalive_time\fP kernel parameter can be found at this URL: \fIhttp://tldp.org/HOWTO/html_single/TCP-Keepalive-HOWTO\fP. If not specified, the default value set by \fBflom\fP daemon is @_DEFAULT_TCP_KEEPALIVE_TIME@ seconds
.TP
.B --tcp-keepalive-intvl=\fIseconds
\fBflom\fP daemon sets SO_KEEPALIVE attribute to every TCP/IP socket connected with a \fBflom\fP command; this parameter allows you to change how many \fIseconds\fP the kernel will wait before a new probe of the TCP/IP connection (the \fIconnection inactivity condition\fP already triggered before successive probes are issued). A good explanation of \fBtcp_keepalive_intvl\fP kernel parameter can be found at this URL: \fIhttp://tldp.org/HOWTO/html_single/TCP-Keepalive-HOWTO\fP. If not specified, the default value set by \fBflom\fP daemon is @_DEFAULT_TCP_KEEPALIVE_INTVL@ seconds
.TP
.B --tcp-keepalive-probes=\fIprobes
\fBflom\fP daemon sets SO_KEEPALIVE attribute to every TCP/IP socket connected with a \fBflom\fP command; this parameter allows you to change how many \fIprobes\fP for a suspicious connection will be tried by the kernel before the connection will be terminated. A good explanation of \fBtcp_keepalive_probes\fP kernel parameter can be found at this URL: \fIhttp://tldp.org/HOWTO/html_single/TCP-Keepalive-HOWTO\fP. If not specified, the default value set by \fBflom\fP daemon is @_DEFAULT_TCP_KEEPALIVE_PROBES@ probes
.TP
.B -T, --command-trace-file=\fIFILENAME
file destination of the trace messages produced by the command (foreground) process; \fIFILENAME\fP must be an absolute path. \fBFLOM_TRACE_MASK\fP environment variable must be set with an active bit for every desired module
.TP
.B -t, --daemon-trace-file=\fIFILENAME
file destination of the trace messages produced by the daemon (background) process; \fIFILENAME\fP must be an absolute path. \fBFLOM_TRACE_MASK\fP environment variable must be set with an active bit for every desired module
.TP
.B --append-trace-file=\fIyes|no
\fBdefault\fP (\fIno\fP): the command will truncate the trace file(s), otherwise (\fIyes\fP) it will append the trace file(s). The number and the name of the trace files depends on \fB-T, --command-trace-file\fP and \fB-t, --daemon-trace-file\fP options
.P
.SH EXIT STATUS
if anything runs as expected, \fBflom\fP exit status is the same of the controlled (serialized) command. Sometimes an error occurs and \fBflom\fP reports it using dedicated exit statuses you can check with \fI$?\fP environment variable:
.P
\fB@_ES_UNABLE_TO_EXECUTE_COMMAND@:\fP \fBflom\fP caught an error trying to exec (see \fIexecvp\fP man page) COMMAND
.P
\fB@_ES_RESOURCE_BUSY@:\fP the resource can \fBnot\fP be locked because it's already locked by someone else (have you used \fB--resource-wait=no\fP option?!)
.P
\fB@_ES_GENERIC_ERROR@:\fP \fBflom\fP caught some type of error and did not execute COMMAND
.P
.SH ENVIRONMENT
environment variable \fBFLOM_TRACE_MASK\fP can be used to activate internal detailed trace. The available flags are explained in file \fIflom_trace.h\fP; you can activate more than one module trace using OR operation between values
.P
