Road map:

Fix PHP examples: advanced.php must be implemented, basic.php must be cleaned-up
Add PHP test cases

remove config property resource_wait; remove from man page too; update wiki site using --resource-timeout instead of --wait

IPv6

SSL 

Java (client)

sequences

transactional sequences (no holes sequences)

put inside function flom_accept_loop_chklockers a check if the thread associated to the locker is really active; it the thread leaved (due to an error), make a clean-up phase. This avoid a daemon crash after a thread terminated with an error, but listener thread has a "locker object" already active

implement FIFO, LIFO, FIRST FIT (for numerical resources) lock allocation policies
