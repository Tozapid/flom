Road map:

transform flom_conn_data_s to flom_conn_t and encapsulate the data related
to TCP (flom_tcp_t) and TLS (flom_tls_t)
flom_conn_t must become the type used for I/O and it should wrap
	flom_tcp_retrieve, flom_tcp_send, flom_tls_retrieve, flom_tls_send
TLS/SSL (in progress...)

check command lines for unique-id
implement different TLS levels: with unique-id, without unique-id, server only

remove config property resource_wait; remove from man page too; update wiki site using --resource-timeout instead of --wait

implement a loop for connect/bind if bind returns an error: this shuold help
to reduce the race condition between a closing daemon and a starting client.
See this thread: https://github.com/tiian/flom/issues/3

transactional sequences (no holes sequences): use a regex like expression
to describe the sequence; for example:
[0-9](2)[A-Z](3)
produces: 00AAA 00AAB 00AAC ... 01AAA 01AAB ... 01ABA 01ABB 01ABC ...

unique timestamps (no two equal timestamps supplied): use a date like expression
to describe the sequence; for example:
%I%M%S
produces: 213105 213106 213209 ... but not: 213105 213105 even if two clients
ask for a unique timestamp during the same second (the second client will wait)

"object" resources with a state, a memory area, managed by FLoM to transform it in a "state manager" other than a "lock manager"; for flom client, the object will be dumped/restored to/from file

"vector" resources with an associative array of memory areas, managed by FLoM (evolution of "object"; for flom client, the vector will be dumped/restored to/from a zip file or a directory

RESTful interface implemented using Mongoose (?)

replace poll custom based implementation with libevent... (is it interesting?)

put inside function flom_accept_loop_chklockers a check if the thread associated to the locker is really active; if the thread leaved (due to an error), make a clean-up phase. This avoid a daemon crash after a thread terminated with an error, but listener thread has a "locker object" already active

implement FIFO, LIFO, FIRST FIT (for numerical resources) lock allocation policies
